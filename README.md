#INTRO
This repository was created to strengthen our git command knowledge and to improve our collaboration skills.
All you have to do is clone the repository to your desktop or PC, add a file or folder to it, pull new changes (if any), check for any merge conflicts after you pull, reconcile these conflicts then push your clean code. Ensure you pull firt before you push and do not push any code with merge conflicts.

#BASIC GIT COMMANDS YOU NEED TO KNOW
git clone: creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project’s files, history, and branches.

git add: stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer’s codebase, but it’s necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project’s history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project’s history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.

git commit: saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that’s been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit.

git status: shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.

git branch: shows the branches being worked on locally.

git pull: updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment.

git push: updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.
